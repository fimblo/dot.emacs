* Things I want to do or to test

Here's a list of stuff I want to add to my configuration:

** DONE omnisharp - completion
was a little outdated, and people seem to be using lsp. But perhaps this is the best tool for csharp??
** DONE flycheck-mode
CLOSED: [2022-08-26 Fri 22:53]
** DONE company-mode
CLOSED: [2022-08-27 Sat 16:31]
** DONE lsp-mode
CLOSED: [2022-08-30 Tue 20:01]
** DONE in emacs-lisp buffer, make company propose across hyphens
  
  Seems I can edit company-dabbrev-modes to include the modes I want
  the hyphens to be included in. Will test later.

  Also, I can set =company-dabbrev-code-everywhere= to =t=.
** DONE integrate projectile into other modes.
CLOSED: [2022-08-30 Tue 22:40]
  see [[./setup.org::#Projectile-mode]]



  I see these when I run =package-list-packages= and run it through =occur <projectile>=:

    #+end_example

  I think of these, I'm most interested in:
  - counsel-projectile
  - flycheck-projectile (?)
  - ibuffer-projectile
  - projectile-ripgrep (?)
  - treemacs-projectile (?)

  After looking at counsel-projectile, I don't think I need it just yet. But Ibuffer-projectile looked nice, so I installed it.

*** toggle treemacs on and off without losing focus on current buffer
Current behaviour is that turning on treemacs with F1 keybinding will move focus to the treemacs buffer. I don't like that.
** DONE See if I can get highlighted regions to be in whitespace-mode
CLOSED: [2022-08-30 Tue 22:50]

  Yeah, looked around a bit and it seems this isn't possible. Perhaps
  I'll look around more at some other point in time. For now, =C-c
  <space>= does the trick.
** TODO Make emacs run icons command once when installed the first time
In =setup.org=, I write this under the section 'Icons and modeline'.

#+begin_example
M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
#+end_example

It would be good if I could auto-detect this and run it manually. I
think there was another section which also required me to run once
after install.


** TODO Tramp is laggy                                                 :bug:

Something in the setup is making tramp terribly slow. Just noticed
today. Opening a file on a remote host, like =C-x C-f
/ssh:hostname:foo.txt= causes emacs to slow down visibly.

Maxing debug verbosity makes it even slower.
#+begin_src
(setq tramp-verbose 10)
#+end_src

I suspect it's some combination of =projectile=, =tramp= or
something. I think it's constantly scanning the remote filesystem or
something.

Very frustrating.

I tried starting emacs with no config with shell command =$(which
emacs) -Q=, and the problem wasn't there.


** TODO flymakecursor - display message in minibuffer             :lookinto:
** TODO rfringe - display buffer-relative locations in fringe.    :lookinto:
** DONE clean old modes out
CLOSED: [2022-10-18 Tue 11:34]
There's a few modes I don't use anymore, and they are cluttering the
config. Remove them or comment them away.
** DONE fix parenthesis highlighting
CLOSED: [2022-10-18 Tue 12:03]
rainbow-delimiters isn't working. Figure out.

Found highlight-parentheses-mode, which is easier to configure than
rainbow-delimiters. Swapped and configured. works nicely now.

** Some notes on how to get lsp to work.

#+begin_src
(setq lsp-keymap-prefix "s-l")

(require 'lsp-mode)

;; generic version
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'lsp)

;; specific for each language, for example
;(add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook #'lsp)

;; deferred server start (till window opens)
;(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'lsp-deferred)

;; Language servers


;; Perl
;; Many to choose from. I chose Perl::LanguageServer
;; This needs to be installed via cpan
#+end_src

** Some notes on getting csharp to work
Start by installing stuff 


#+begin_src 
package-install lsp-mode
package-install lsp-ui
package-install csharp-mode
#+end_src

** Now install omnisharp using lsp-install-server.
#+begin_src 
lsp-install-server <ret> omnisharp
#+end_src


** Configure emacs to use lsp for csharp.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq lsp-keymap-prefix "s-l")
(require 'lsp-mode)
(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook #'lsp)
#+end_src

After opening a csharp file, you'll get this in the minibuffer:

#+begin_example
Unable to find installed server supporting this file. The following servers could be installed automatically:
csharp
#+end_example

Hit enter to download support for csharp.

In the minibuffer, you'll see the following:

#+begin_example
LSP :: Download csharp started.
LSP :: Starting to download https://github.com/omnisharp/....
LSP :: Finished downloading /Users/fimblo/.emacs.d/.cache/lsp/omnisharp-roslyn/latest/omnisharp-roslyn.zip...
(Shell command succeeded with no output)
LSP :: Server csharp downloaded, auto-starting in 1 buffers.
LSP :: Yasnippet is not installed, but `lsp-enable-snippet' is set to `t'. You must either install yasnippet, or disable snippet support.
LSP :: Connected to [csharp:48644/starting].
LSP :: csharp:48644 initialized successfully in folders: (/Users/fimblo/Projects/firstProjectwHk/Assets)
#+end_example

Now write some csharp code:

First let's make a dotnet project:
#+begin_example

$ dotnet new console -n MyApp

Telemetry
---------
The .NET tools collect usage data in order to help us improve your experience. It is collected by Microsoft and shared with the community. You can opt-out of telemetry by setting the DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to '1' or 'true' using your favorite shell.

  Restored /Users/fimblo/Projects/MyApp/MyApp.csproj (in 40 ms).
Restore succeeded.
#+end_example

Copy this text into the file MyApp/Program.cs:

#+begin_src csharp
namespace HelloWorld {
    class Hello {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            System.Console.WritLine("hello world");

        }
    }
}
#+end_src

And it should warn you about the error if all works as it should.


Next you want to run it. Try =dotnet run=.

#+begin_example
$ dotnet run
hello world
#+end_example


Now let's tune lsp. Use =M-x lsp-doctor= to start the diagnostic tool. I got this:

#+begin_example
Checking for Native JSON support: OK
Check emacs supports `read-process-output-max': OK
Check `read-process-output-max' default has been changed from 4k: ERROR

`gc-cons-threshold' increased?: ERROR
Using gccemacs with emacs lisp native compilation (https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html): NOT AVAILABLE (OPTIONAL)
#+end_example

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; To fix 'gc-cons-threshold', add this snippet:
(setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000)

;; Increase read-process-output-max from 4k to 1M
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024))
#+end_src


** sr-speedbar

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'sr-speedbar)
   (global-set-key (kbd "s-s") 'sr-speedbar-toggle)
   (setq sr-speedbar-right-side nil)
   (setq speedbar-show-unknown-files t)
   (setq speedbar-use-images t)
   (setq sr-speedbar-width 30) 
   (setq sr-speedbar-max-width 30) 
 #+end_src
